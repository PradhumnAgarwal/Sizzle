# Sizzle

We have created a food ordering and review system website.
In this we can Sign Up/Login both as customers and restaurant owners.
For beginning we added Cash On Delivery, which can easily be extended to other payment methods.
As Restaurants Owners we can add or delete Dishes or can even update Restaurant Info.
As customers after ordering food we can give Review and Ratings.

# Features Implemented
